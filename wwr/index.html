                            The Wild & Scenic stretch of the Rogue River is Oregon’s classic multiday rafting trip with fun rapids nestled within a forested and rugged river canyon. The trip starts west of the small town of Merlin. Rafters will wind their way downstream for roughly 40 miles. Whitewater highlights include the famous Rainie Falls, Mule Creek Canyon and — perhaps Oregon’s most iconic rapid — Blossom Bar. Off the river and at camp, hiking opportunities and historical points of interest abound. The lush landscape of the Rogue River Canyon means picturesque views for the entire trip.Trips are offered from April through October.

                            To the north of Crater Lake and not far from the headwaters of the Rogue River flows the Wild & Scenic North Umpqua River. “The Ump,” as we sometimes call it, offers a variety of whitewater thrills within a beautifully forested river canyon. The Umpqua’s whitewater alone would be enough to lure most rafters to the river — but add in plentiful camping, a nearby hot spring and a stunning hike to Toketee Falls, and your rafting adventure has morphed into a whole lot more. The North Umpqua’s most famous rapid, Pinball, will have you skillfully dodging boulders; it is often the highlight of the trip.

                        If you are looking for warm weather coupled with continuous Class-IV whitewater, the Upper Klamath is going to be your best bet. The trip starts with a good warm-up of Class-III rapids before launching rafts into the Class-IV Hell’s Corner — 14 miles from start to finish will quench your thirst for whitewater. This Wild & Scenic river runs all summer long at the same flow because of hydropower production.
